      <p><a href="#" target="_blank">‘Blank Space’</a> is Swift’s attempt to challenge the way the media choose to represent her. She exaggerates “her” behaviour through the media’s perception within the narrative. It makes the audience question whether she actually behaves in the way the media portray her.</p>
