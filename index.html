      <h1 class="">How are media representations of</br> <strong>"Taylor Swift" </strong>challenged in the video <strong>‘Blank Space’?</strong></h1>
      <p>‘Blank Space’ is Swift’s attempt to challenge the way the media choose to represent her. She exaggerates “her” behaviour through the media’s perception within the narrative. It makes the audience question whether she actually behaves in the way the media portray her.</p>

        <p align="justify">1989 is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2014 through Big Machine Records. Songwriting for the album commenced in mid-2013, during which time contemporary critics had noted her fourth studio album Red for its mild departure from Swift's signature country sound and incorporation of straightforward pop production, a result of her collaborations with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback. </p>

It was released on October 22, 2012, by Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her third studio album, Speak Now. The album title was inspired by the "semi-toxic relationships" that Swift experienced during the process of conceiving this album, with Swift describing the emotions she felt as "red emotions" due to their intense and tumultuous nature.</p>
